Must-have
---------
Code:
- Fine tune calibration parameters
- Fix the bug in the CITL SGD
- Add docstrings and comments
- Clean up todos etc.
- Fix circular imports
- -> change branch of slm-controller to master

Documentation:
- Extend with final setup, write down distances etc. -> important to right, lenses, distances, etc.
- Update all the function names and interfaces
- Add expected results of different algos, simulated and photos
- How do you save a pattern in Pattern Generator
- Adapt to lightweight CITL
- GIF of SGD phase and simulation
- Is beam after concave lens diverging or less converging? -> diverging adapt

Nice-to-have
------------
Code:
- Enable waveprop propagator (done?)
- Tests
- Get rid of [None, None, :, :] etc.
- Use own dataloader

Future
------
Code:
- Parametric model of propagation, fix
- Add Raspberry Pi cam
- clean up code structure
- DPAC algo: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3072959.3073624
