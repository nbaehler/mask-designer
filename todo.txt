Must-have
---------
Code:
- Fine tune calibration parameters
- Fix the bug in the CITL SGD
- Change examples to be lensed or lensless
- Increase ROI to the max by increasing distance to camera
- Add docstrings and comments
- Clean up todos etc.
- Keep experimental setup or add arguments everywhere
- Remove parametric model?
- Fix circular imports

Documentation:
- Extend with final setup, write down distances etc.
- Update all the function names and interfaces
- Add expected results of different algos, simulated and photos
- How do you save a pattern in Pattern Generator
- Adapt to lightweight CITL
- Check that RST is equivalent to md and remove those
- GIF of SGD phase and simulation
- Is beam after concave lens diverging or less converging?
- Why not just use convex lens and set propdistance accordingly?

Nice-to-have
------------
Code:
- Enable waveprop propagator (done?)
- Tests
- Get rid of [None, None, :, :] etc.
- Use own dataloader

Future
------
